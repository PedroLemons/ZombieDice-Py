College project to replicate a dice game for Programming logic in python.

The rules of the game can be found [here](http://www.sjgames.com/dice/zombiedice/img/ZDRules_English.pdf), which include: randomly rolling specific dice, 
holding some, re-rolling others, taking dice out and putting back in the cup, scoring points, reseting the score, 
playing turn by turn and round by round until someone reach a specific score.

Worked with conditional and repetition structures, tuples and lists to achieve the goal in a pretty fun way of studying and learning.
